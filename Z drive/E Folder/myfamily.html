			<h3>These are my family members:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><div id='dadinfo'>
					<h4>Roy Ruel Mosqueda(My Father)</h4>
					<img src="../Images/IMG_20140901_191420.jpg" id='pa'> 
						<p>This is my dad. I guess you know now where I get my good looks now huh hahaha! He's a very suportive father and the best dad I could ever have. He's always there for me and will protect everyone in my family. </p>
					</div></li>
				<li><div id='mominfo'>
					<h4>Maria Carmen Mosqueda(My Mother)</h4>
					<img src="../Images/IMG_20141207_122714.jpg" id='ma'>
						<p>My mom is where I get my wit. She is very good at talking and intrapersonal relations. She might even pass off as a grifter she says proudly haha. Though she is most of the time hard to deal with especially if you want a raise in your baon or go out with your squad and whatnot, she is also a loving person. She acts like that because she cares about me and I can never return all the favors she's done for me.</p>
					</div></li>
				<li><div id='broinfo'>
					<h4>Johan Manuel Mosqueda(My Brother)</h4>
					<img src="../Images/IMG_20140831_203852.jpg" id='yo'>
						<p>Lastly here's my brother Johan. We call him Yong for informal reasons. He's pretty much your average ordinary everyday brother: young stubborn abnoxious and hard to handle. But he can be kind at times </p>
